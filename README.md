## Contributer

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


## Learning Goals
* Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of
  * DRY JavaScript
  * localStorage to persist data
* Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## What Should Happen? 👨🏾‍💻 👩🏾‍💻
 * The user loads the web page and selects a game level of either "classic" or "difficult."
 * The user makes a selection of a fighter to play against a randomizer generator.
 * A winner or a draw is determined.
 * The scores are updated for each win, saved into local storage and displayed on the DOM. 
 * After the game, the board is reset to the icons for the user to choose a new fighter.
 * If the user decides to try another level, their is a change game button available that will return them to the home page.
